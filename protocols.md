# Communication Protocols

## What are communication protocols?
- Communication protocols are the set of rules that allow two or more electronic devices to connect and exchange data with each other.

## RS-232 Communication Protocol
- Standard protocol used for serial communication.
- Uses the binary system to transmit data in ASCII format.
- Serial communication up to 50 feet (15.24 meters) with a rate of 1.492 kbps.
- Two-way communication.
- Similar to UART but supports longer cables.

### RS-232 Characteristics
- 2 devices.
- Short distance (<20m).
- More sensitive.
- Slow data rate (kbps).

### How does RS-232 work with Arduino?
- The Arduino Mega uses TTL UART (0V - 5V levels), but RS-232 uses Â±12V signaling, which can damage the Arduino's pins.
- You need an RS-232 to TTL converter module.

### RS-232 Wiring
1. Connect Arduino TX (Pin 18 - TX1) to MAX232 TTL RX.
2. Connect Arduino RX (Pin 19 - RX1) to MAX232 TTL TX.
3. Connect MAX232 RS-232 TX to the external device's RS-232 RX.
4. Connect MAX232 RS-232 RX to the external device's RS-232 TX.
5. Power MAX232 from Arduino's 5V and GND.

## RS-485 Communication Protocol
- Duplex communication system in which multiple devices on the same bus can communicate in both directions.
- Multi-drop and two-wire type of communication that allows communication with multiple devices at the same time.
- At a time, 32 devices can be connected on the same line.
- Maximum distance: 1200 m.
- Many PLCs allow connections of up to 128 slave nodes.
- 2-wire or 4-wire network.
- The 4-wire network is bidirectional, and the 2-wire network is unidirectional.

### RS-485 Characteristics
- 32 devices.
- Long distance (1000m).
- Less sensitive.
- Fast data rate (Mbps).
- Two-wire (half-duplex) and four-wire (full-duplex) configuration.

### How does RS-485 work with Arduino?
- To use RS-485 with an Arduino, you need an RS-485 transceiver module.
- To convert TTL signals to RS-485 differential signals, use:
  - MAX485, SN75176, or an RS-485 shield.
